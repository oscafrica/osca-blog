# OnBoarding Guidelines for Technical Writers

> This guide is for new Chapter leads and Technical Writers

# Chapter Leads

As chapter leads, it is expected that you write a recap article after every event like [this](https://blog.oscafrica.org/oscalagos-give-back-weekend-recap-cjz0fie64000n3ds1woj5ukpc), which would be published on our blog. Here's how to get started:

- Upon completion of your event, prepare a draft recap article with the following information:
  - Introduction to the event
  - How did the event go
  - Recap of each talk with pictures
  - Link to speaker slides
  - Link to event photos
  - Attendees feedback(s)
  - Special thanks to sponsor(s), speaker(s) and attendees
  - Conclusion <br />
  
 > Your draft should be submitted on or before 72 hours after the event. If there would be any delays, feel free to contact the Technical Writing Team.
  
- Our blog is powered by [Devblog](https://hashnode.com/devblog) Team Publication, and it is expected that you create a Devblog account to have your articles published with us.
  - Head to https://hashnode.com and create an account
  - Head to https://hashnode.com/devblog and create your personal Devblog [If you get stuck, please read the docs or contact Support]

- Contact any member of the Technical Writing team on [Zulip](https://oscafrica.zulipchat.com/) or Bolaji on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iambolajiayo) to request access to the blog
